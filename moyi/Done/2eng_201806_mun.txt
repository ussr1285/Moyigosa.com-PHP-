Patricia is eager to be the best mom she can be, but she
finds parenting a hard task. Here\’s how she put it: \“Just when
I think I have it down, then something changes, and I have to
make major adjustments. Parenting well feels like a moving
target.\” Patricia is correct. In fact, much research has been
done on the developmental stages of childhood. Babies learn to
sit up, then crawl, and finally walk. Kids have a greater ability
to reason as they get older, and logic makes sense as they move further into preadolescence. A logical implication of
these developmental changes is that parents will need to make
parenting shifts along the way. In other words, the one strategy to keep in mind as your children grow and change is
that you must also change to meet their new developmental
needs and abilities.

While backpacking through Costa Rica, Masami found herself
in a bad situation. She had lost all of her belongings, and had
only $5 in cash. To make matters worse, because of a recent
tropical storm, all telephone and Internet services were down.
She had no way to get money, so decided to go knocking door
to door, explaining that she needed a place to stay until she
could contact her family back in Japan to send her some money. Everybody told her they had no space or extra food
and pointed her in the direction of the next house. It was already dark when she arrived at a small roadside restaurant.
The owner of the restaurant heard her story and really
empathized. Much to her delight, Masami was invited in. The owner gave her some food, and allowed her to stay there until
she could contact her parents.

The development of writing was pioneered not by gossips,
storytellers, or poets, but by accountants. The earliest
writing system has its roots in the Neolithic period, when
humans first began to switch from hunting and gathering to a settled lifestyle based on agriculture. This shift began
around 9500 B.C. in a region known as the Fertile Crescent,
which stretches from modern‑day Egypt, up to southeastern
Turkey, and down again to the border between Iraq and
Iran. Writing seems to have evolved in this region from the
custom of using small clay pieces to account for transactions
involving agricultural goods such as grain, sheep, and cattle.
The first written documents, which come from the
Mesopotamian city of Uruk and date back to around 3400
B.C., record amounts of bread, payment of taxes, and other
transactions using simple symbols and marks on clay tablets.

Why do you go to the library? For books, yes — and you
like books because they tell stories. You hope to get lost in a story or be transported into someone else\’s life. At one type of library, you can do just that — even though there\’s
not a single book. At a Human Library, people with unique
life stories volunteer to be the \“books.\” For a certain amount
of time, you can ask them questions and listen to their
stories, which are as fascinating and inspiring as any you can find in a book. Many of the stories have to do with some kind of stereotype. You can speak with a refugee, a soldier suffering from PTSD, and a homeless person. The
Human Library encourages people to challenge their own existing notions — to truly get to know, and learn from, someone they might otherwise make quick judgements about.

We create a picture of the world using the examples that
most easily come to mind. This is foolish, of course,
because in reality, things don\’t happen more frequently just
because we can imagine them more easily. Thanks to this
prejudice, we travel through life with an incorrect risk map
in our heads. Thus, we overestimate the risk of being the
victims of a plane crash, a car accident, or a murder. And we underestimate the risk of dying from less spectacular
means, such as diabetes or stomach cancer. The chances of
bomb attacks are much rarer than we think, and the chances
of suffering depression are much higher. We attach too much
likelihood to spectacular, flashy, or loud outcomes. Anything
silent or invisible we downgrade in our minds. Our brains
imagine impressive outcomes more readily than ordinary ones. ① We Weigh Dramatic Things More!

After earning her doctorate degree from the University of
Istanbul in 1940, Halet Cambel fought tirelessly for the
advancement of archaeology. She helped preserve some of
Turkey\’s most important archaeological sites near the
Ceyhan River and established an outdoor museum at
Karatepe. There, she broke ground on one of humanity\’s
oldest known civilizations by discovering a Phoenician
alphabet tablet. Her work preserving Turkey\’s cultural
heritage won her a Prince Claus Award. But as well as revealing the secrets of the past, she also firmly addressed
the political atmosphere of her present. As just a 20­year­old archaeology student, Cambel went to the 1936
Berlin Olympics, becoming the first Muslim woman to
compete in the Games. She was later invited to meet Adolf
Hitler but she rejected the offer on political grounds.

Getting in the habit of asking questions (A) [transform /transforms]

Do you advise your kids to keep away from strangers?
That\’s a tall order for adults. After all, you expand your
network of friends and create potential business partners by
meeting strangers. Throughout this process, however,
analyzing people to understand their personalities is not all
about potential economic or social benefit. There is your safety
to think about, as well as the safety of your loved ones. For
that reason, Mary Ellen O\’Toole, who is a retired FBI
profiler, emphasizes the need to ___________________
in order to understand them. It is not safe, for instance, to assume that a stranger is a good neighbor, just because
they\’re polite. Seeing them follow a routine of going out
every morning well‑dressed doesn\’t mean that\’s the whole
story. In fact, O\’Toole says that when you are dealing with a criminal, even your feelings may fail you. That\’s because
criminals have perfected the art of manipulation and deceit[3점].

\“Survivorship bias\” is a common logical fallacy. We\’re
prone to listen to the success stories from survivors
because the others aren\’t around to tell the tale. A dramatic
example from history is the case of statistician Abraham
Wald who, during World War Ⅱ, was hired by the U.S. Air
Force to determine how to make their bomber planes safer.
The planes that returned tended to have bullet holes along
the wings, body, and tail, and commanders wanted to
reinforce those areas because they seemed to get hit most
often. Wald, however, saw that the important thing was that
these bullet holes had not destroyed the planes, and what
needed more protection were ___________________. Those were the parts where, if a plane was struck by a bullet, it would never be seen again. His calculations based on that logic are still in use today, and they have saved
many pilots[3점].

In the early 2000s, British psychologist Richard Wiseman
performed a series of experiments with people who viewed
themselves as either \‘lucky\’(they were successful and happy,
and events in their lives seemed to favor them) or
\‘unlucky\’(life just seemed to go wrong for them). What he
found was that the \‘lucky\’ people were good at spotting
opportunities. In one experiment he told both groups to
count the number of pictures in a newspaper. The \‘unlucky\’
diligently ground their way through the task; the \‘lucky\’
usually noticed that the second page contained an announcement that said: \“Stop counting — there are 43
photographs in this newspaper.\” On a later page, the
\‘unlucky\’ were also too busy counting images to spot a note
reading: \“Stop counting, tell the experimenter you have seen this, and win $250.\” Wiseman\’s conclusion was that, when
faced with a challenge, \‘unlucky\’ people were less flexible.
They focused on a specific goal, and failed to notice that

Appreciating __________________ can correct our false notions of how we see the world. People love heroes.
Individuals are given credit for major breakthroughs. Marie
Curie is treated as if she worked alone to discover
radioactivity and Newton as if he discovered the laws of
motion by himself. The truth is that in the real world,
nobody operates alone. Scientists not only have labs with
students who contribute critical ideas, but also have
colleagues who are doing similar work, thinking similar
thoughts, and without whom the scientist would get nowhere.
And then there are other scientists who are working on different problems, sometimes in different fields, but
nevertheless set the stage through their own findings and
ideas. Once we start understanding that knowledge isn\’t all
in the head, that it\’s shared within a community, our heroes

Thinking of an internal cause for a person\’s behaviour is
easy — the strict teacher is a stubborn person, the
devoted parents just love their kids.
</div>
<br>
You may be wondering why people prefer to prioritize
internal disposition over external situations when seeking causes to explain behaviour. One answer is simplicity. (①)
In contrast, situational explanations can be complex. (②)
Perhaps the teacher appears stubborn because she\’s seen the
consequences of not trying hard in generations of students
and wants to develop self‑discipline in them. (③) Perhaps
the parents who\’re boasting of the achievements of their
children are anxious about their failures, and conscious of
the cost of their school fees. (④) These situational
factors require knowledge, insight, and time to think through.
(⑤) Whereas, jumping to a dispositional attribution is far
easier[3점].

Recently, however, some researchers found that how
people are praised is very important.
</div>
A child bounces up to you holding her school work;
perhaps she\’s your daughter, cousin, or neighbour. (①)
She proudly shows you a big red A at the bottom of her
test paper. (②) How do you praise her? (③) For
decades, people have been told that praise is vital for happy
and healthy children and that the most important job in
raising a child is nurturing her self‑esteem. (④) They
discovered that if you say \“What a very clever girl you are!\”
to the child showing you an A, you may cause her more harm than good. (⑤) For your children to succeed and be
happy, you need to convince them that success comes from
effort, not from some talent that they\’re born with or without.

The body has an effective system of natural defence
against parasites, called the immune system. The immune
system is so complicated that it would take a whole book to
explain it. ① Briefly, when it senses a dangerous parasite,
the body is mobilized to produce special cells, which are carried by the blood into battle like a kind of army. ② Usually
the immune system wins, and the person recovers. ③ After
that, the immune system remembers the molecular equipment
that it developed for that particular battle, and any following
infection by the same kind of parasite is beaten off so quickly that we don\’t notice it. ④ As a result, the weakened
immune system leads to infection, and the infection causes damage to the immune system, which further weakens
resistance. ⑤ That is why, once you have had a disease like
the measles or chicken pox, you\’re unlikely to get it again.

The wife of American physiologist Hudson Hoagland
became sick with a severe flu. Dr. Hoagland was curious
enough to notice that whenever he left his wife\’s room for a short while, she complained that he had been gone
for a long time. In the interest of scientific investigation,
he asked his wife to count to 60, with each count
corresponding to what she felt was one second, while he
kept a record of her temperature. His wife reluctantly
accepted and he quickly noticed that the hotter she was,
the faster she counted. When her temperature was 38
degrees Celsius, for instance, she counted to 60 in 45
seconds. He repeated the experiment a few more times,
and found that when her temperature reached 39.5
degrees Celsius, she counted one minute in just 37
seconds. The doctor thought that his wife must have some kind of \‘internal clock\’ inside her brain that ran faster as the fever went up.

David Stenbill, Monica Bigoutski, Shana Tirana. I just
made up these names. If you encounter any of them

where you saw them. You know, and will know for a while, that these are not the names of minor celebrities.
But suppose that a few days from now you are shown a
long list of names, including those of some minor
celebrities and \“new\” names of people that you have never heard of; your task will be to check every name of a celebrity on the list. There is a substantial probability
that you will identify David Stenbill as a well‑known
person, although you will not know whether you
encountered his name in the context of movies, sports, or politics. Larry Jacoby, the psychologist who first
demonstrated this memory illusion in the laboratory, titled
his article \“Becoming Famous Overnight\”. How does this
happen? Start by asking yourself how you know whether or not someone is famous. In some cases of truly famous
people, you have a mental file with rich information about a person — think Albert Einstein, Michael Jackson, or Hillary Clinton. But you will have no file of information
about David Stenbill if you encounter his name in a few
