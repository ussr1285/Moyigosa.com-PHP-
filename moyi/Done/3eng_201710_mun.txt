One time, my boss and I were sitting around the table and
I pitched an idea about the trend of screenplays being
published and sold as literature. My boss approved it. It was
the first time she had given me the go­ahead to report and
write a feature. It meant a lot to me that I\’d possibly have
my name on a longer piece. I felt so happy that I set about
the work immediately. I wrote a draft, which was of course
open to making revisions. My boss reviewed it and just said,
\“No, this isn\’t working.\” She didn\’t say why or offer advice
about how to fix it. I knew that the first draft wouldn\’t be
perfect; still, I wasn\’t prepared for such an instant rejection.
It was almost as if she drained my energy and enthusiasm.

Suppose a child throws a ball to another child intending to
start a game of catch. The other child is not watching and
the ball hits the child on the head. The child cries and runs
to tell the teacher about the aggressive behaviour of the
other \‘naughty\’ child. Of course the child who threw the ball
is innocent but, if we have defined aggression in terms of
pure behaviour, the consequences of an act, then the child
who throws the ball is unfairly guilty. Clearly we need to
take intention into account when we define aggression. We
can now move to a more complete definition if we say that
aggression is any behaviour that is intended to hurt others.

A new development may take years to evolve. If people
are only informed of a new proposal in its final stages, their
role is often limited to the negative one of rejecting it.
Their protests are then seen by planners and developers as
an expensive nuisance, so the public become the \‘enemy\’.
Many people would like their voices to be heard from the
initial stages of a proposed new development, instead of at
the last stages of an application. Some architects and
developers see this as a threat and insult to their
professional skills, rather than a two­way process, beneficial
to all parties. Of course the public cannot design a building,
but its involvement at an early stage adds to the information
available, and replaces a confrontational \‘them and us\’
situation by a democratic process of participation and
consultation. This situation is now changing as the
importance of public consultation becomes increasingly
recognised.

Birds, as a whole group, are more sensitive to changes in
their environment than other animals, so when they start
falling off perches we should all be troubled. They are in
the forward­most trench of nature\’s resistance against the
relentless attrition of environmental degradation. Our birds
are nature\’s early warning system and the scientists are
telling us that if we don\’t start acting on their distress
signals, it won\’t be long before the rest of the animal world
is overrun as well. The populations of many species are
declining rapidly because habitats are being destroyed or
undermined, food sources are disappearing and, tricked by
the increasingly weird and unstable weather, the birds\’
migration and breeding patterns are changing. In short, birds
are confused and under stress. Just because you can hear
your robins, goldfinches, and sparrows chirping away happily
in the garden every morning, don\’t be fooled into thinking
that all is well in \‘birdworld\’.

Appealing though it might be to offload the responsibility
for teaching our students basic knowledge to their
elementary school teachers or to the Internet, the research
of cognitive psychologists who study learning and the basic
study habits of most students suggest that we cannot do
this. One of our first and most important tasks as teachers
is to help students develop a rich body of knowledge in our
content areas — without doing so, we handicap considerably
their ability to engage in cognitive activities like thinking
and evaluating and creating. As cognitive psychologist Daniel
Willingham argued, you can\’t think creatively about
information unless you have information in your head to
think about. \“Research from cognitive science has shown,\” he
explained, \“that the sorts of skills that teachers want for
their students — such as the ability to analyze and think
critically — require extensive factual knowledge.\” We have to
know things, in other words, to think critically about them.

Nicolas Appert was born in Châlons­sur­Marne, on the
edge of France\’s Champagne region, in 1749. He became an
accomplished chef and served in the kitchens of various
noblemen before setting up as a confectioner in Paris in
1781. In this line of work he was necessarily aware of the
use of sugar to preserve fruit, and he wondered whether it
could be used to preserve other foods. As his interest in
food preservation grew he began to experiment with storing
food in sealed champagne bottles. In 1795 he moved to the
village of Ivry­sur­Seine, where he began to offer preserved
foods for sale, and in 1804 he set up a small factory to
produce them. By this time some of his preserved food had
been tested by the French navy, which was impressed by its
quality. Appert had devised his methods solely by
experiment and had no idea why it worked.

One characteristic of people who have achieved peace of

Nobody can tell them what to think if their inner voices say
otherwise. Brendan O\’Regan tells about a doctoral student

within a 300­mile radius had experienced a remission.
Twenty­five people replied. She noticed that many of them
were farmer\’s wives who had in common a strong faith in ____________________. When she asked one of her interview
subjects how she had felt when the doctor told her she had
a terminal illness, the woman simply said, \“I figured that

So closely is sniffing tied to odor perception that people
routinely sniff when they are asked to imagine a smell.
Without prompting, they take larger sniffs when imagining
pleasant odors and smaller ones when imagining malodors.
During visual imagery the eyes explore an imagined scene
using the same scan paths made when viewing the actual
visual scene. Preventing eye movements during visual
imagery — by having people stare at a stationary target —
reduces the quality of the image. Smell researcher Noam
Sobel found that, similarly, imagined odors were more vivid
when people could sniff than when they were wearing nose
clips and unable to sniff. Actually sniffing increased the
unpleasantness of an imagined bad smell (urine) and
increased the pleasantness of a good one (flowers). Sniffing
at an imaginary odor isn\’t an absent­minded habit — it\’s a
behavior that ____________________.

People change over time, often for the better. Maturity,
wisdom, patience, and many other strengths can result from
the gradual accumulation of life experiences. But do these
qualities have to develop slowly? Researcher Timothy Carey
and colleagues recently examined the idea that ____________________. They conducted structured interviews
with people who had just finished psychotherapy. Reports of
aha moments abounded. One interviewee said that he could
\“visualize the point\” at which he changed; another said, \“I
could actually hear it.\” Many of them could identify the
moment at which they had their realizations, such as in a
swimming pool with a spouse or in a particular meeting with
a therapist. Some used familiar metaphors to describe their
ahas, such as a light being turned on, a button being
pressed, a click, or a \“\‘ping\’ and then it was like I could see
things clearly.\” Personal growth doesn\’t have to be a glacial
process. As physician­author Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.,
wrote, \“A moment\’s insight is sometimes worth a life\’s
experience.\”

② one\’s strengths and weaknesses are not fixed

Renewal and reform always depend on a capacity for going
backwards to go forward. Key to this process is a search
within one\’s own mind for a model according to which
reformed practice can be organized. Architects have long
appealed to a primitive hut as just such a model. It is a
structure thought to provide access as close to the first
principles of architecture as it is possible to get, yet traces
of this structure exist nowhere other than in the mind\’s eye
of the architect searching for it. Nonetheless, absence of the
primitive hut from physical reality does little to diminish its
importance for the renewal of present practices. If a desired
(or required) thing resides in paradise, and no current map

Large satellites for collecting solar power and transmitting
it to the Earth have been the subject of much study. Their
potential is vast indeed. ①The energy from the Sun that
reaches the Earth over the course of just three days is
equal to the energy in the fossil fuels needed to keep the
human race supplied with power for 100 years at the
present rate of consumption. ②Many engineering problems
of transmitting the power back to the Earth remain unsolved,
and it remains unclear if and when solar power will become
commercially competitive. ③A satellite of just 155 miles
(250 km) in diameter could supply all of our present energy
needs, assuming 10% overall efficiency, with a very low
carbon footprint. ④Solar panels in orbit are always in
sunlight, they can always point directly at the Sun, and the
radiation from the Sun is not reduced by atmospheric
absorption. ⑤As a result, the energy intake for cells in
orbit is on average about ten times greater than that of
terrestrial ones.

not all of them, have both communal music­making
where everyone participates and where the notion of
musical talent is irrelevant, and special ritual and
ceremonial music where only the specially talented and
trained perform, and where the rest listen and
participate as observers.<br>
(B) In addition to such events, there was also communal
music­making, especially at festivals such as the Winter
Solstice, Harvest time, Spring time, and other secular
celebrations where everyone participated. Music in the
Christian church is similarly organised with communally
sung hymns, anthems, and other liturgical items sung by
the specially trained choir.<br>
(C) That is, specially trained musicians performed and the
audience was expected to contemplate the musical
aesthetic as they listened. It is from this tradition that
the instrumental and vocal forms of modern western
music have evolved. <br>

 The force of gravity is always attractive. It is a force
pulling together any two things that have mass. Any
amount of mass will cause the attraction, but the more
mass the stronger the force.
</div>
(A) That\’s because objects always have a positive amount
of mass. There is no such thing as negative mass. It\’s
not like electric charge that comes in both positive and
negative values.<br>
(B) That\’s why a brick is heavier than a balloon, heavier
and harder to hold or move in opposition to the force of
gravity. The force also depends on the distance between
the objects: the greater the distance the weaker the
force.<br>
(C) The attraction gets weaker and weaker as the objects
get further apart, but it never disappears altogether.
The force never goes to zero. And it never pushes
things away.<br>

Should two ideas directly contradict one another,
\“resistance occurs\” and \“concepts become forces when
they resist one another.\”
</div>
According to Johann Herbart, a German philosopher, ideas
form as information from the senses combines. The term he
used for ideas — Vorsfellung — encompasses thoughts, mental
images, and even emotional states. These make up the entire
content of the mind, and Herbart saw them not as static but
dynamic elements, able to move and interact with one
another. (①) Ideas, he said, can attract and combine with
other ideas or feelings, or repulse them, rather like magnets.
(②) Similar ideas, such as a color and tone, attract each
other and combine to form a more complex idea. (③)　 
However, if two ideas are unalike, they may continue to
exist without association. (④) This causes them to weaken
over time, so that they eventually sink below the \“threshold
of consciousness.\” (⑤) They repel one another with an
energy that propels one of them beyond consciousness, into a
place that Herbart referred to as \“a state of tendency\”; and
we now know as \“the unconscious.\”

In order to lighten the weight of the logs to be shifted,
some inventive soul cut two cross sections out of a log
and put a pole through the middle of both, making a
wheel and axle.
</div>
The wheel has been around five thousand years, more or
less, so archaeologists tell us. (①) Someone of our
forefathers early on noticed that a round log was easier to
roll than to carry. (②) The next step was to figure out
that heavy objects could be moved by rolling them on three
logs, keeping two logs under the load and shifting the log
that rolled out the back up to the front. (③) The next
step was to fit a platform on the axle in such a way that
the axle stayed in one place and the wheels turned round
and round. (④) This ancient inventor had thus invented
the wagon that five thousand years later became a modern
car. (⑤) The wheel business began, speculatively, in
Mesopotamia and from there spread to the rest of the Old
World — Europe, Africa, and Asia.

 Perspective is defined as the art of picturing objects
as they appear to the eye. We have been taught to
represent distant objects as smaller, thereby giving the
illusion of depth. But are they really smaller? The child
knows that the man fifty feet away is just as big as the
one five feet away. So why draw one smaller than the
other? The child\’s drawings are not reproductions of an
optical image. He uses size to impart emphasis and
importance. He draws his concept of the object. His
drawing is consequently more meaningful than a faithful
reproduction. Objectivity can be achieved by photography.
Many true artists use distortion, exaggeration, or
reduction to essentials. The child draws the man bigger
than the tree in his front yard because to him the man
is more significant. For the same reason, we see the
person bigger than the house.

 Traditionally, systems have been designed and developed
from a technology­centered perspective. Engineers developed
the sensors and systems that were needed to perform each
function. They then provided a display for each system that
informed the operator of how well that particular system
was operating or its present status. So, for example, in the
aircraft cockpit a separate display was provided for altitude,
airspeed, engine temperature, etc. As technology improved,
more and more displays were added. People were left with
the job of trying to keep pace with the dramatic growth of
data created by this process. In the face of changing tasks
and situations, the operator is called upon to find, sort,
integrate, and process the information that is needed from
all that which is available, leading inevitably to an
information gap. Unfortunately, the human has certain information
processing bottlenecks. People can only pay attention to a
certain amount of information at once. As the display of
data in these systems is centered around the technologies
producing them, it is often scattered and not ideally suited
to support human tasks. A considerable amount of
additional work is required to find what is needed and
extra mental processing is required to calculate the
information the operator really wants to know. This
inevitably leads to higher than necessary workload and
error. has become harder and harder to do.
