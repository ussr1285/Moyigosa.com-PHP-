On December 6th, I arrived at University Hospital in
Cleveland at 10:00 a.m. I went through the process of
admissions. I grew anxious because the time for surgery
was drawing closer. I was directed to the waiting area,
where I remained until my name was called. I had a few
hours of waiting time. I just kept praying. At some point in
my ongoing prayer process, before my name was called, in
the midst of the chaos, an unbelievable peace embraced me.
All my fear disappeared! An unbelievable peace overrode my
emotions. My physical body relaxed in the comfort provided,
and I looked forward to getting the surgery over with and
working hard at recovery.

You are far more likely to eat what you can see in plain
view. Organize the foods in your kitchen so the best choices
are most visible and easily accessible. It also helps to hide
poor choices in inconvenient places. An even better idea is
to simply get rid of anything with low nutritional value that
you may be tempted to eat. Put fruits, vegetables, and other
healthy options at eye level in your refrigerator, or leave
them out on the table. Even when you aren\’t hungry, simply
seeing these items will plant a seed in your mind for your
next snack. Also consider taking small bags of nuts, fruits,
or vegetables with you when you are away from home. That
way, you can satisfy a mid­afternoon craving even if no
good options are available. <br>* craving: 갈망, 욕구

Playing any game that involves more than one person
teaches kids teamwork, the consequences of cheating, and
how to be a good team player whether they win or lose. It\’s
not hard to see how those skills make it into the daily lives
of kids. But like all things we hope to teach our children,
learning to cooperate or to compete fairly takes practice.
Humans aren\’t naturally good at losing, so there will be
tears, yelling, and cheating, but that\’s okay. The point is,
playing games together helps kids with their socialization. It
allows them a safe place to practice getting along, following
rules, and learning how to be graceful in defeat.

The public growth of the Internet began in the 1990s, as
increasing numbers of computers came into homes and
workplaces. The first online newspaper was published in the
US and the Chicago­based Tribune was among the first titles
to put its content online, in 1991. As the decade progressed,
software developments made the task of creating online
content quicker and cheaper — between 1995 and 1998, the
number of US dailies on the web grew from 175 to 750.
Newspapers in the UK followed the same pattern: in 1994,
the Sunday Times became the UK\’s first newspaper to have
an online edition and a few months later the Daily Telegraph
launched the Electronic Telegraph, Europe\’s first online
daily.

Each spring in North America, the early morning hours are
filled with the sweet sounds of songbirds, such as sparrows
and robins. While it may seem like these birds are simply
singing songs, many are in the middle of an intense
competition for territories. For many birds, this struggle
could ultimately decide whom they mate with and if they
ever raise a family. When the birds return from their winter
feeding grounds, the males usually arrive first. Older, more
dominant males will reclaim their old territories: a tree,
shrub, or even a window ledge. Younger males will try to
challenge the older ones for space by mimicking the song
that the older males are singing. The birds that can sing the
loudest and the longest usually wind up with the best
territories. <br>* ledge: 선반 모양의 공간

Grant Wood grew up on a farm and drew with whatever
materials could be spared. Often he used charcoal from the
wood fire to sketch on a leftover piece of brown paper. He
was only ten when his father died, and his mother moved
the family to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where Wood went to
school. He studied part­time at the State University of Iowa
and attended night classes at the Art Institute of Chicago.
When he was 32, he went to Paris to study at the
Académie Julian. In 1927, he traveled to Munich, Germany,
where some of the most accomplished artists of the period
were working. While there, he saw German and Flemish
artworks that influenced him greatly, especially the work of
Jan van Eyck. After that trip, his style changed to reflect
the realism of those painters.
① 남은 종이 위에 숯을 사용하여 스케치하기도 했다. ② 열 살 때 아버지가 돌아가셨다. ③ 대학에서 시간제로 공부를 한 적이 있다. ④ Jan van Eyck의 작품에서 영향을 받았다. ⑤ 독일 여행 후에 사실주의 화풍에서 벗어났다.

marshmallow treat if they chose to eat it immediately, but
two treats if they waited. Most of the children, who ranged

used differed significantly. The 4­year­olds often chose to
look at the marshmallows while waiting, a strategy that was
not terribly effective. In contrast, 6­ and 8­year­olds used
language to help overcome temptation, although in different
ways. The 6­year­olds spoke and sang to themselves,
reminding themselves they would get more treats if they
waited. The 8­year­olds focused on aspects of the
marshmallows unrelated to taste, such as appearance, which

just after he left the White House in 1909, he made his first
public appearance at Madison Square Garden. Before he would
agree to make the appearance, he carefully arranged for
nearly one thousand paid applauders to be scattered
throughout the audience to applaud his entrance on the
platform. For more than 15 minutes, these paid hand­clappers
made the place ring with their enthusiasm. The rest of the
audience took up the suggestion and joined in for another
quarter hour. The newspaper men present were literally
swept off their feet by the tremendous applause given the
American hero, and his name was emblazoned across the
headlines of the newspapers in letters two inches high.

In addition to controlling temperatures when handling fresh
produce, control of the atmosphere is important. ①Some
moisture is needed in the air to prevent dehydration during
storage, but too much moisture can encourage growth of
molds. ②Some commercial storage units have controlled
atmospheres, with the levels of both carbon dioxide and
moisture being regulated carefully. ③Though living things
emit carbon dioxide when they breathe, carbon dioxide is
widely considered to be a pollutant. ④Sometimes other
gases, such as ethylene gas, may be introduced at controlled
levels to help achieve optimal quality of bananas and other

Two major kinds of age­related structural changes occur in
the eye. One is a decrease in the amount of light that
passes through the eye, resulting in the need for more light
to do tasks such as reading. (①) As you might suspect,
this change is one reason why older adults do not see as
well in the dark, which may account in part for their
reluctance to go places at night. (②) One possible logical
response to the need for more light would be to increase
illumination levels in general. (③) In addition, our ability
to adjust to changes in illumination, called adaptation,
declines. (④) Going from outside into a darkened movie

A clay pot is an example of a material artifact, which,
although transformed by human activity, is not all that
far removed from its natural state.
</div>
By acting on either natural or artificial resources, through
techniques, we alter them in various ways. (①) Thus we
create artifacts, which form an important aspect of
technologies. (②) A plastic cup, a contact lens, and a
computer chip, on the other hand, are examples of artifacts
that are far removed from the original states of the natural
resources needed to create them. (③) Artifacts can serve
as resources in other technological processes. (④) This is
one of the important interaction effects within the
technological system. (⑤) In other words, each new
technology increases the stock of available tools and
resources that can be employed by other technologies to
produce new artifacts. 
<br>* artifact: 가공품

Despite all the talk of how weak intentions are in the
face of habits, it\’s worth emphasizing that much of the
time even our strong habits do follow our intentions. We
are mostly doing what we intend to do, even though it\’s
happening automatically. This probably goes for many
habits: although we perform them without bringing the
intention to consciousness, the habits still line up with
our original intentions. Even better, our automatic,
unconscious habits can keep us safe even when our
conscious mind is distracted. We look both ways before
crossing the road despite thinking about a rather
depressing holiday we took in Brazil, and we put oven
gloves on before reaching into the oven despite being
preoccupied about whether the cabbage is overcooked. In
both cases, our goal of keeping ourselves alive and
unburnt is served by our automatic, unconscious habits.

Mary is an interior designer. A friend of hers bought a
house that needed to be renovated, and had asked her to
do the interior decoration. Mary wanted the interior of the
house to look attractive. However, she would ignore
safety standards and would not listen to other contractors,
if she did not think their proposals fit her ideals. For all
the home products she picked for the house, her main
concern was whether they looked attractive, not whether
they were effective or reliable. She chose a fancy­looking
door lock, against the advice of the locksmith who did
not think it was dependable. As a consequence, a year
later, it was necessary to change the door lock, as there
was difficulty opening the lock with the key.
In addition, she picked toilets in an upscale model and
design. However, the homeowner later found out that the
toilet handle must be held down to complete the flushing
action. The plumber was not able to adjust the lever
inside the toilet tank to fix the problem.
Mary prefers to think that she is always right. She
chooses information that fits her _________, and ignores
other people\’s recommendations. However, when facing a
problem, we should always have an open mind, and
should consider all relevant information. We definitely
should not let our prejudice and emotion take the better
part of us.

In May 1977, Leif Rongemo in Malmö, Sweden,
returning from the kitchen to the living room of his third
floor apartment, discovered that the casement window
was open and his two­year­old daughter was missing
from the living room. When he looked outside, he saw
the street thirty­six feet below ― and (a) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">his</span> little
daughter crawling on all fours along a narrow concrete
ledge that circled the building. (b) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">He</span>He tried not to let
out a cry of alarm to avoid startling her, because an
extraordinary kind of rescue was already under way. <br>* casement: 여닫이 창(문)

<div class=\"joe_example_box\">
He called his wife to help from the window while (c) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">he</span>
rushed down to the street to try to catch the child. As
the baby girl crawled farther away from the window and
safety, the dog pushed forward determinedly and at last
seized the child\’s diaper in his jaws. To the amazement
of those who had gathered on the street below ― they
were attempting to create a net to catch the child ― the
dog then moved carefully backwards, inch by inch,
pulling the little girl back toward the window.
</div>
<div style=\"text-align: center;font-weight:bold;\">(C)</div>
<div class=\"joe_example_box\">
Following just behind the baby girl was the family\’s
Alsatian dog, whining softly in distress. Both dog and
daughter were far beyond reach and there was no room
on the narrow ledge for either to turn around and crawl
back to the window. The father quickly realized that if
(d) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">he</span> attempted to get on the ledge, all three would
probably die.

<div style=\"text-align: center;font-weight:bold;\">(D)</div>
<div class=\"joe_example_box\">
The heart­pounding backwards journey took three
minutes, until the mother could snatch her child. The
dog then leapt into the room, proudly wagging his tail.
The family had been thinking of giving the dog to
someone because they were concerned he might be too
big to keep around a small child. His bold rescue of
their daughter, however, made (e) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">him</span> a most treasured
member of the family.
