Dear Ms. Cross,<br>
<br>
We are excited to announce the opening of the
newest Sunshine Stationery Store in Raleigh, North
Carolina! As you know, the Sunshine Stationery

One day I caught a taxi to work. When I got into the back
seat, I saw a brand new cell phone sitting right next to me.
I asked the driver, \“Where did you drop the last person
off?\” and showed him the phone. He pointed at a girl
walking up the street. We drove up to her and I rolled down
the window yelling out to her. She was very thankful and by
the look on her face I could tell how grateful she was. Her
smile made me smile and feel really good inside. After she
got the phone back, I heard someone walking past her say,
\“Today\’s your lucky day!\”

Many people think of what might happen in the future based
on past failures and get trapped by them. For example, if you
have failed in a certain area before, when faced with the same
situation, you anticipate what might happen in the future, and
thus fear traps you in yesterday. Do not base your decision on
what yesterday was. Your future is not your past and you
have a better future. You must decide to forget and let go of
your past. Your past experiences are the thief of today\’s
dreams only when you allow them to control you. <br>* anticipate: 예상하다

Storyteller Syd Lieberman suggests that it is the story in
history that provides the nail to hang facts on. Students
remember historical facts when they are tied to a story.
According to a report, a high school in Boulder, Colorado, is
currently experimenting with a study of presentation of
historical material. Storytellers present material in dramatic
context to the students, and group discussion follows.
Students are encouraged to read further. In contrast, another
group of students is involved in traditional research/report
techniques. The study indicates that the material presented
by the storytellers has much more interest and personal
impact than that gained via the traditional method.
① why students should learn history
② essential elements of historical dramas
③ advantages of traditional teaching methods
④ benefits of storytelling in teaching history
⑤ importance of having balanced views on history

Experts advise people to \“take the stairs instead of the
elevator\” or \“walk or bike to work.\” These are good
strategies: climbing stairs provides a good workout, and
people who walk or ride a bicycle for transportation most
often meet their needs for physical activity. Many people,
however, face barriers in their environment that prevent
such choices. Few people would choose to walk or bike on
roadways that lack safe sidewalks or marked bicycle lanes,
where vehicles speed by, or where the air is polluted. Few
would choose to walk up stairs in inconvenient and unsafe
stairwells in modern buildings. In contrast, people living in
neighborhoods with safe biking and walking lanes, public
parks, and freely available exercise facilities use them often — their surroundings encourage physical activity. <br>* stairwell: 계단을 포함한 건물의 수직 공간

How can we teach our children to memorize a broad range
of information? Let me prove to you that all people are
potential geniuses, with brains designed to store, control,
and remember large amounts of information through
memorization by repetition. Imagine the grocery store where
you shop the most. If I asked you to tell me where the
eggs are, would you be able to do so? Of course you could.
The average grocery store carries over 10,000 items, yet
you can quickly tell me where to find most of them. Why?
The store is organized by category, and you have shopped in
the store repeatedly. In other words, you\’ve seen those
organized items over and over again, and the arrangement by
category makes it easy for you to memorize the store\’s
layout. You can categorize 10,000 items from just one store.

Just think for a moment of all the people upon whom your
participation in your class depends. Clearly, the class
requires a teacher to teach it and students to take it.
However, it also depends on many other people and
organizations. Someone had to decide when the class would
be held and in what room, communicate that information to
you, and enroll you in that class. Someone also had to write
a textbook, and with the assistance of many other people —

The philosopher G. A. Cohen provides an example of a
camping trip as a metaphor for the ideal society. (①) On
a camping trip, he argues, it is unimaginable that someone
would say something like, \“I cooked the dinner and therefore
you can\’t eat it unless you pay me for my superior cooking
skills.\” (②) Rather, one person cooks dinner, another sets
up the tent, another purifies the water, and so on, each in

are shared and a spirit of community makes all participants
happier. (④) Moreover, the experience would be ruined if
people were to behave in such a way. (⑤) So, we would

happily ever after. (①) Often the conflict in those stories
is only partly resolved, or a new conflict appears making the
audience think further. (②) This is particularly true of
thriller and horror genres, where audiences are kept on the
edge of their seats throughout. (③) Consider Henrik
Ibsen\’s play, A Doll\’s House, where, in the end, Nora leaves
her family and marriage. (④) Nora disappears out of the
front door and we are left with many unanswered questions
such as \“Where did Nora go?\” and \“What will happen to
her?\” (⑤) An open ending is a powerful tool, providing
food for thought that forces the audience to think about
what might happen next. <br>* definitive: 확정적인

In 2006, 81% of surveyed American shoppers said that
they considered online customer ratings and reviews
important when planning a purchase. Though an online
comment — positive or negative — is not as powerful as a
direct interpersonal exchange, it can be very important for a
business. ①Many people depend on online recommendations.
②And young people rely heavily on them and are very
likely to be influenced by the Internet when deciding what
movie to see or what album to purchase. ③These
individuals often have wide­reaching social networks and
communicate regularly with dozens of others — with the
potential to reach thousands. ④Experts suggest that young
people stop wasting their money on unnecessary things and
start saving it. ⑤It has been reported that young people
aged six to 24 influence about 50% of all spending in the
US.

Crows are a remarkably clever family of birds. They
are capable of solving many more complex problems
compared to other birds, such as chickens. After
hatching, chickens peck busily for their own food much
faster than crows, which rely on the parent bird to bring
them food in the nest. However, as adults, chickens have
very limited hunting skills whereas crows are much more
flexible in hunting for food. Crows also end up with
bigger and more complex brains. Their extended period
between hatching and flight from the nest enables them
to develop intelligence. <br>* peck: (모이를) 쪼아 먹다

Think of the most famous scientists you know — Isaac
Newton, Louis Pasteur, Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison,
Pierre and Marie Curie, Stephen Hawking, and so on.
What do all these people have in common? Well, for one
thing, they\’re all very smart. In some cases they even
taught themselves most of what they knew about their
particular subject. In fact, Sir Isaac Newton had to
invent a new branch of mathematics (calculus) just to
solve the problems he was trying to do in physics.
There is something else they all had in common that set
them apart from the other smart people of their time —
their ability to ask questions.
Just having a good brain isn\’t always enough. To be a
great scientist, you need to be able to look at a problem
that hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people have
already looked at and have been unable to solve, and ask
the question in a new way. Then you take that question
and come up with a new way to answer it. That is what
made Newton and the others so famous. They __________
intelligence with a curiosity that said, \“I want to know
the answer to this.\” After coming up with the right
questions, they discovered ways of answering those
questions and became famous for their discoveries. <br>* calculus: 미적분학
