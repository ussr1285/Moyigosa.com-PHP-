There was a flash of movement in the window. Richard

pounded before. There now standing in the room, the same

What is your goal in writing a particular paper or giving a

in one sentence. For example, one of Bob\’s first papers as a
psychology student was written to show that individual
differences in children\’s intelligence could not be explained
by genetic factors alone. Sure, he reviewed the literature on
inheritance of intelligence. And of course he reviewed the
literature on environmental effects on intelligence. But he
had no thesis. Good papers do not merely review literature
and then say something like \“there are many different points
of view, all of which have something useful to say.\” When
you communicate via a paper, talk, or poster, be clear about
what you want to show, and show it.

Plant and animal species are so diverse that the old saying
\“beauty is in the eye of the beholder\” could be the perfect
slogan for nature\’s bounty. It\’s easy for most people to see
the breathtaking beauty found in the brightly colored wings
of butterflies, a field of blooming wildflowers, or a forest of
hardwood trees in their autumn glory. But what about snails
and their trails of slime, rats with yellow teeth, or spiders
that look like fierce aliens? These species are beautiful in
their own right — just not in a traditional sense. Recognition
of their unique beauty may require setting aside any
preconceptions — or misconceptions — people may have about
fungi, insects, or reptiles. People seem to be hardwired to
see warm and fuzzy mammals as cute, while often lacking
this innate and immediate attraction to the cold­blooded,
eight­legged, or egg­laying members of the animal kingdom.
Yet beauty is in no short supply among these animals.

During the last two decades many developing countries
have joined the global tourism market as part of globalization
processes and the fall of the Iron Curtain. These countries
had suffered from negative public and media image which
made it challenging for them to compete over tourists with
countries with strong and familiar brands. In this global era,
a problematic image is a major obstacle in attracting
tourists, high­quality residents and investors. However, in
the case of destinations suffering from prolonged image
crises, it seems almost unrealistic to expect any target
audience to visit a destination and \“put aside\” these
long­lasting negative images and stereotypes, just because of
an advertising campaign or other promotional effort. Tackling
prolonged negative place images is crucial for developing
tourism in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, Eastern
Europe and Asia. Although these destinations differ greatly,
in the eyes of many potential tourists they all suffer from
weak place images, negative stereotypes and problematic
perceptions.
① growing conflicts between tourists and local people
② roles of media in shaping the global trend in tourism
③ necessity of global cooperation for sustainable tourism
④ importance of the tourism industry in national economy
⑤ developing nations\’ need to improve destination images

With the general accessibility of photocopiers in student
libraries, students tend to copy the relevant material for
later use. In such cases the students are not always
selective about what they copy. Often useless material is
gathered that may seem important at the time but does not
seem so in their study room on the night before an exam or
essay due date. In addition, when most people photocopy
material from books, they feel as if they have actually
accomplished something. After all, a few photocopied pages
in their notebook now represent information that used to be
in a big, thick book. The reality of the situation is that
nothing significant has been accomplished yet. The student
only has the information in a transportable form. He or she
has not learned anything from the material. The information
content of the photocopied sheets is just as foreign as if it
had been left on the library shelf.

② Reasons You Should Keep Study Material After Exams

The above graph shows how the United States managed
solid waste compared to five European nations in 2011. ① The
United States had lower percentages of \“Recycling or
composting\” and \“Energy from waste,\” and a higher percentage
of \“Landfilled\” than the five European nations. ② Burying solid
waste in landfills was the most commonly used solid waste
management technique in the United States, accounting for 69
percent of total solid waste disposal. ③ On the other hand,
\“Landfilled\” took up zero (or statistically insignificant) percent
in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, and just 1 percent in
Belgium and Sweden respectively. ④ Among the five European
nations, Austria recorded the lowest percentage of \“Energy

United States. ⑤ The United States recycled or composted
about a quarter of its total solid waste, but Sweden recycled

Jacqueline Cochran was raised by foster parents in a poor
town in Florida. When she was about eight years old, the
family moved to Columbus, Georgia, where she worked 12
hours a day in a factory. Her formal education lasted only
two years; she learned to read and write on her own. In
1932 she met her future husband, Floyd Odlum, who
encouraged her to learn to fly. Cochran loved flying and
participated in many air races. Before World War II, she
volunteered her services to the Royal Air Force. She
recruited qualified women pilots in the United States and
took them to England where they joined the air force. After
the war, Cochran set more than 200 flight records in her
career. In 1953, she became the first woman pilot to break
the sound barrier. Additionally, she was the first female to
pilot a jet across the Atlantic.
① Columbus에 있는 공장에서 하루 12시간 동안 일했다. ② 정규 교육을 2년 받았고 읽기와 쓰기는 스스로 깨우쳤다. ③ 비행기 조종을 배우라는 격려를 Floyd Odlum에게 받았다. ④ 영국에서 여성 조종사를 모집하여 미국으로 데려갔다. ⑤ 제트기를 조종하여 대서양을 횡단한 최초의 여성이었다.

It is important to note that the primary goal of the

less important to children. In one of our own studies, we
found that teams\’ won­lost records had nothing to do with

however, success of the team was related to how much the

Typically an individual cannot accurately assess the gains
and costs likely to occur in social interactions. Even the
intrinsic satisfactions associated with the individual\’s own
behaviors may turn sour if the other person somehow does
the wrong thing. For example, a person may derive intrinsic
satisfaction from helping others; so if the recipient
reciprocates favor for favor, both intrinsic and extrinsic
satisfaction derive from the profitable interaction. However,
the recipient may ignore or even resent the good­intended
gesture as patronizing and may verbally abuse the favor
doer, thereby increasing the costs, perhaps spoiling the
intrinsic satisfaction (gain) of the behavior, and hence
leaving the favor doer with a net loss for the interaction.

(B) High building density, therefore, helps to reduce the
pressure to develop open spaces and releases more land

(C) This may happen when high­density development is

avoid the negative impacts of high density, thorough

 Music is a specialized branch of learning, at least as it
applies to the musician. While we might expect that
members of society who take part in singing only as
members of a larger group may learn their music
through imitation, musicianship, seen as a special skill,
usually requires more directed learning.

(A) Behaviors which are successful have persisted in the form
of customs, while those which are unsuccessful have
suffered extinction. This accumulation of adaptive habits
is passed on to the child; he does not simply learn
through imitation how to get along in the world; rather,
he is enculturated.<br>
(B) It may be added that in any society an individual learns
only a small portion of his cultural habits by free
trial­and­error, for in this way he would learn only those
habits which were most rewarding to him and to him
alone.<br>
(C) Such indiscriminate and selfish learning cannot be allowed
by society; the individual must learn behavior which is
specified in the culture as being correct or best. Such
behavior is, of course, the result of the learning process
as carried on by previous generations.<br>

They even ignored a dying gaslight industry\’s warning to
its few remaining customers that electric light projected
a toxic ray that would turn their skin green and increase
their death rate.

Recovering from a series of early failures, Edison regained
his reputation as a great inventor, and electric wiring in the
home gained wide acceptance. (①) It wasn\’t that people
necessarily became less fearful of electricity, but rather, as
they became more familiar with it, they began to believe
that the risks could be managed with some safety
precautions. (②) People began to accept the trade­off of
the risk of accidental death from electricity for better and
cheaper lighting and work­saving electrical appliances. (③)
They simultaneously experienced a lower risk of candle and
gaslight fires. (④) This made­up claim was seen by the
public as the scare tactic that it was, and they were

and the death rate from house fires decreased accordingly.

And yet for many potential subjects, cooperating with
journalists is still a bargain worth striking.
In today\’s digital environment, appearing in the mainstream
news is still an important way citizens can communicate with
a broader community about events and issues. (①)
Journalists can provide credibility, status, and a guaranteed
large audience that many citizens do not feel they can get any
other way. (②) However, to access those benefits, subjects
must yield control to journalists over how their stories are
told to the public. (③) That is a big risk, since news
stories have a great deal of credibility with their audiences:
whether subjects themselves feel the news coverage is
accurate or not, they will have to deal with the consequences
of many people believing it. (④) If news coverage portrays
them as socially deviant or otherwise morally unfit, the
resulting stigma can be profound and enduring. (⑤) The
benefits of addressing, or simply displaying oneself to, a large
news audience can be so great that many subjects conclude
they are worth the risks of being misrepresented.

Major long­term threats to deep­sea fishes, as with all
life on the planet, derive from trends of global climate
change. Although deep­sea fishes are generally cold­water
species, warming of the oceans itself may not be a direct
threat. Many of the deep­sea fishes originated during the
early Cretaceous when the deep sea was warm, and the
Mediterranean Sea, which is warm down to a depth of
over 5,000 m, is populated by deep­sea fishes. On the
other hand, substantial changes may be expected in ocean
ecosystems over the next 100 years driven by an
increase in dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and consequent
ocean acidification resulting from burning of fossil fuels.
Although the effects on deep­sea fishes are likely to be
indirect through loss of coral habitats and changes in prey
availability, larval stages of deep­sea fishes in the surface
layers of the ocean may be directly affected by acidity.

Alex Pentland\’s Human Dynamics Laboratory at MIT
investigated a huge Bank of America call center where the
emphasis was on productivity; reducing the average call
handle time at that one call center by just 5 percent would

employees into teams of about twenty, but they didn\’t
interact much, in part because their work was entirely
solitary, sitting in a cubicle with a phone and a computer.<br>
They were unlikely to run into each other very often
anyway because the bank staggered break times in order to
keep staffing levels steady. Here was a team that barely
justified the term.<br>
Yet the members did interact a bit, and when Pentland
asked them to wear the sociometric badges for six
weeks, he found that the best predictor of team
productivity was how much the members interacted in
the little time they had, and what he calls \“engagement,\”
the degree to which all team members were involved in
the interaction. So Pentland proposed that managers try
an experiment: Give a whole twenty­person team their
coffee break at the same time. In a call center of over
3,000 employees, it was easy to shift others\’ breaks to
maintain service. The result was that group members
interacted more, though it still wasn\’t much; more of
them were involved in the interaction; and productivity
rocketed. The effects were so clear that the bank
switched to _____________ breaks at all its call centers,
