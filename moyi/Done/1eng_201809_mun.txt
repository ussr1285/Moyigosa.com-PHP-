 Garnet blew out the candles and lay down. It was too hot
even for a sheet. She lay there, sweating, listening to the
empty thunder that brought no rain, and whispered, \“I wish
the drought would end.\” Late in the night, Garnet had a feeling
that something she had been waiting for was about to happen.
She lay quite still, listening. The thunder rumbled again,
sounding much louder. And then slowly, one by one, as if
someone were dropping pennies on the roof, came the
raindrops. Garnet held her breath hopefully. The sound paused.
\“Don\’t stop! Please!\” she whispered. Then the rain burst
strong and loud upon the world. Garnet leaped out of bed and
ran to the window. She shouted with joy, \“It\’s raining hard!\”
She felt as though the thunderstorm was a present. ① wishful → excited ② embarrassed → proud

 How do you encourage other people when they are
changing their behavior? Suppose you see a friend who is on
a diet and has been losing a lot of weight. It\’s tempting to
tell her that she looks great and she must feel wonderful. It
feels good for someone to hear positive comments, and this
feedback will often be encouraging. However, if you end the
discussion there, then the only feedback your friend is
getting is about her progress toward an outcome. Instead,
continue the discussion. Ask about what she is doing that
has allowed her to be successful. What is she eating?
Where is she working out? What are the lifestyle changes
she has made? When the conversation focuses on the
process of change rather than the outcome, it reinforces the
value of creating a sustainable process. ① 상대방의 감정을 고려하여 조언해야 한다. ② 토론 중에는 지나치게 공격적인 질문을 삼가야 한다.

 It might seem that praising your child\’s intelligence or
talent would boost his self­esteem and motivate him. But it
turns out that this sort of praise backfires. Carol Dweck
and her colleagues have demonstrated the effect in a series
of experimental studies: \“When we praise kids for their
ability, kids become more cautious. They avoid challenges.\”
It\’s as if they are afraid to do anything that might make
them fail and lose your high appraisal. Kids might also get
the message that intelligence or talent is something that
people either have or don\’t have. This leaves kids feeling
helpless when they make mistakes. What\’s the point of
trying to improve if your mistakes indicate that you lack
intelligence?

 Fast fashion refers to trendy clothes designed, created,
and sold to consumers as quickly as possible at extremely
low prices. Fast fashion items may not cost you much at
the cash register, but they come with a serious price: tens
of millions of people in developing countries, some just
children, work long hours in dangerous conditions to make
them, in the kinds of factories often labeled sweatshops.
Most garment workers are paid barely enough to survive.
Fast fashion also hurts the environment. Garments are
manufactured using toxic chemicals and then transported
around the globe, making the fashion industry the world\’s
second­largest polluter, after the oil industry. And millions
of tons of discarded clothing piles up in landfills each year. <br>* sweatshop: 노동착취공장

 If you want to protect yourself from colds and flu, regular
exercise may be the ultimate immunity­booster. Studies
have shown that moderate aerobic exercise can more than
halve your risk for respiratory infections and other common
winter diseases. But when you feel sick, the story changes.
\“Exercise is great for prevention, but it can be lousy for
therapy,\” says David Nieman, the director of the Human
Performance Lab. Research shows that moderate exercise
has no effect on the duration or severity of the common
cold. If you have the flu or other forms of fever­causing
systemic infections, exercise can slow recovery and,
therefore, is a bad idea. Your immune system is working
overtime to fight off the infection, and exercise, a form of
physical stress, makes that task harder. <br>* respiratory: 호흡기의

thought, record it as an audio note. If you read a funny
article, save the link in your bookmarks. The world is a

If you ask a physicist how long it would take a marble to
fall from the top of a ten­story building, he will likely answer
the question by assuming that the marble falls in a vacuum.
In reality, the building is surrounded by air, which applies
friction to the falling marble and slows it down. Yet the
physicist will point out that the friction on the marble is so
small that its effect is negligible. Assuming the marble falls in
a vacuum simplifies the problem without substantially affecting
the answer. Economists make assumptions for the same
reason: Assumptions can simplify the complex world and make
it easier to understand. To study the effects of international
trade, for example, we might assume that the world consists
of only two countries and that each country produces only two
goods. By doing so, we can __________________________. Thus, we are in a better position to understand international
trade in the complex world.

However, thinking about it this way overlooks debt among
people in low­income brackets who have no other way
than debt to acquire basic necessities of life.

 Have you heard someone say, \“He has no one to blame but
himself\” for some problem? In everyday life we often blame
people for \“creating\” their own problems. (①) Although
individual behavior can contribute to social problems, our
individual experiences are often largely beyond our own
control. (②) They are determined by society as a whole ―
by its historical development and its organization. (③) If a
person sinks into debt because of overspending or credit card
abuse, other people often consider the problem to be the
result of the individual\’s personal failings. (④) By contrast,
at middle­ and upper­income levels, overspending takes on a
variety of meanings typically influenced by what people think
of as essential for their well­being and associated with the
so­called \“good life\” that is so heavily marketed. (⑤) But
across income and wealth levels, larger­scale economic and
social problems may affect the person\’s ability to pay for
consumer goods and services[3점].

So a patient whose heart has stopped can no longer be
regarded as dead.
</div>
 Traditionally, people were declared dead when their hearts
stopped beating, their blood stopped circulating and they
stopped breathing. (①) So doctors would listen for a
heartbeat, or occasionally conduct the famous mirror test to
see if there were any signs of moisture from the potential
deceased\’s breath. (②) It is commonly known that when
people\’s hearts stop and they breathe their last, they are
dead. (③) But in the last half­century, doctors have
proved time and time again that they can revive many
patients whose hearts have stopped beating by various
techniques such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (④)
Instead, the patient is said to be \‘clinically dead\’. (⑤)
Someone who is only clinically dead can often be brought
back to life. <br>* cardiopulmonary resuscitation: 심폐소생술(CPR)

 At the Leipzig Zoo in Germany, 34 zoo chimpanzees
and orangutans participating in a study were each
individually tested in a room, where they were put in
front of two boxes. An experimenter would place an
object inside one box and leave the room. Another
experimenter would enter the room, move the object into
the other box and exit. When the first experimenter
returned and tried retrieving the object from the first
box, the great ape would help the experimenter open the
second box, which it knew the object had been
transferred to. However, most apes in the study did not
help the first experimenter open the second box if the
first experimenter was still in the room to see the
second experimenter move the item. The findings show
the great apes understood when the first experimenter
still thought the item was where he or she last left it.

It\’s reasonable to assume that every adult alive today
has, at some point in their life, expressed or heard from
someone else a variation of the following: \“Where did all
the time go?\” \“I can\’t believe it\’s the New Year. Time
flies!\” \“Enjoy it. One day you\’ll wake up and you\’ll be
50.\” While different on the surface, the sentiment behind
these phrases is the same: time feels like it moves
faster as we get older. But why does this happen?
According to psychologist Robert Ornstein, the speed of
time and our perception of it is heavily influenced by
how much new information is available for our minds to
absorb and process. In essence, the more new information
we take in, the slower time feels. This theory could
explain in part why time feels slower for children.
Assigned the enormous task of absorbing and processing
all this new perceptual and sensory information around
them, their brains are continuously alert and attentive.
Why? Because everything is ___________. Consider the
mind of a child: having experienced so little, the world is
a mysterious and fascinating place. Adults and children
may live in the same world, but reality for a child is
vastly different ― full of wonders and curiosities and
miraculous little events that most adults ignore. Perhaps
this is why we think so fondly about the joy of
childhood, that freedom of mind and body before the
world becomes familiar and predictable.

 A 10­year­old boy decided to learn judo despite the
fact that he had lost his left arm in a devastating car
accident. The boy began lessons with an old Japanese
judo master. The boy was doing well, so (a) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">he</span> couldn\’t

<div class=\"joe_example_box\">
 On the way home, after reviewing all the matches he
had, he summoned the courage to ask what was on his
mind. \“Master, how did I become the champion with only
one move?\” \“You won for two reasons,\” the master
answered. \“First, you\’ve mastered one of the most
difficult throws in all of judo. And second, the only
